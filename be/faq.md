:flag_us: **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why isn't a command working even though I am typing it right?** A: Either a command was removed or the bot is missing permissions.

**Q: What language is the bot written in?** A: Python, discord.py library.

**Q: Can I contribute to Dredd's source?** A: Yes, the link to the code is available via the `-source` command.

**Q: Can I reduce the cooldowns of the commands?** A: No. They're there for a reason.

**Q: Why isn't the bot responding to any of the commands?** A: If you're using the correct default prefix (`-`) and it wasn't changed in the server, the bot might be missing permissions to send messages or you were blacklisted from using the bot. To make sure the prefix hasn't been changed you can mention the bot and it should return the set prefix for that server, if it doesn't respond, invoke `@Dredd prefix` command and it will insert your guild's data into the database. If it still doesn't work, please open a ticket (#open-a-ticket) so we could tell you more information.

**Q: I want to boost this server, what will I get for that?** A: You can see all the perks you get in #announcements's pinned messages

**Q: I was blacklisted and would like to get unblacklisted.** A: Please open a ticket (#open-a-ticket) so we could discuss about it.

**Q: How do I run your bot? Github doesn't provide any information.** A: As stated in github: "If you don't understand something, google it. Our support server **DOES NOT** provide support for cloning Dredd.", however if you open a ticket or dm any of the staff and cry about us not helping you clone the bot, you **WILL** get banned from the server.
